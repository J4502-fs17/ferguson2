<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
  <div class="article">
    <img src="img/intropicsample.jpg" alt="Intro photo"/>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>On August 9, 2014, an 18-year-old black man by the name of Michael Brown was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. That one shooting would spark months of protests and unrest in Ferguson that would plaster the headlines of news media worldwide. The Ferguson protests would bring into the national conversation intense debates over police brutality, racial inequality, justice reform and many other issues.
<p>What our research has done is to provide an insightful, local and interdisciplinary analysis of the Ferguson activist movement. We explored the relationship between media, education and geography of the St. Louis area and how that has shaped the community activism we saw in Ferguson. While much researchhas been done about the political significance of the Michael Brown case, what we have focused on is the role of organizing and media activism in the aftermath of Michael Brown’s death.</p>
<p><strong>Two main parts consist of this research: the media and social geography.</strong> In turn, we researched how these two parts come together to educate and inform the citizens of Ferguson into organizing themselves. Thus, this research will shed light onto local community activists and the local activism going on often left by news media in the background. Additionally, this research aims to combat the stereotype of communities of color being ill-resourced and unstable and show how these communities have the capability to organize and transform their environment. Essentially, this research goes beyond the singular national focus on policing that happened during the Ferguson protests and offers a broader picture of St. Louis’ racialized and classed dynamics through a local lens.</p>

    <h3>I.</br> HISTORY OF RACIAL AND SOCIECONOMIC DIVIDE</h3>
    <div class="article">
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>St. Louis is one of the most segregated cities in the United States, and in St. Louis, it is no better exemplified than through the Delmar Divide. North of St. Louis's Delmar Boulevard is 95% black. South of it is two-thirds white (Cooperman).And not surprisingly, the northern part fares off worse economically and socially. None of this is coincidental; it is a result of a deliberate effort by racist institutions that it has turned out this way.</p>
      <p>In 1900, St. Louis had more than 35,000 African-American residents, second only to Baltimore (Cooperman). Many white workers feared that they were taking away jobs, or that lower-paid workers would decrease the value of houses. Because of this economic tension, racist policies developed.</p>
      <p>One of the first attempts was that St. Louis passed a reform ordinance, prohibiting anyone from buying a home in a neighborhood that was occupied by 75% of another race. SCOTUS striked this ordinance down, but racial covenants, which asked every family to sign a document agreeing to not sell their property to a black person, were still legal until 1948. Nevertheless, all this had effects in maintaining segregation in St. Louis.</p>
      <p>Another method the government used to maintain segregation was eminent domain. In building highways and infrastructure, the government would purposely build it through African-American communities, essentially destroying them. The displaced residents were sometimes then given vouchers to live in public housing, such as the infamous Pruitt-Igoe, which basically moved entire populations of African-Americans. Some places were declared "slums" and therefore dangerous, and the governent destroyed those places.</p>
      <p>There was segregation, but there was also different treatment of the the black and white communities that were segregated.  The government played a role in criminalizing the black parts of St. Louis. Local zoning policies allocated areas, which tended to be more populated by African-Americans, as "slums" or "ghettos" and thus needed more policing and "nuisance codes."</p>
      <p>All these factors led to the segregation and socioeconomic divide one sees in St. Louis over time and history.</p>

<h3>III.<br/> GROUND ACTIVISM VS SOCIAL MEDIA </h3>

    <h4> Subtitle </h4>
    <p>The Ferguson Movement did not only physically resist the carceral space of St. Louis City and County, it also moved into the digital space of social media. Arendt’s (1958) conceptualization of the polis as the “organization of the people as it arises out of acting and speaking together” provides a framework for analyzing the construction of physical and digital space (p. 199). Space, then, “constitutes and structures relationships and networks” and positions “social and cultural life” (Martin & Miller, 2003, p. 144-145). How space produces and is produced by media infrastructures has become a central question in scholarship integrating social geography with media studies. The notion that spatiality is “constituted through… but also shapes social action” is extended to technologies that also shape spatiality (Leitner, Sheppard, Sziarto, 2008). In other words, analyses of spatiality, social movements and media have examined the ways “space is produced” through local and digital spatial contexts (Barnett, 2004, p. 59). More specifically, the spatial politics of media images, production and consumption, or what Couldry (2004) calls “MediaSpace,” present a dialectical relationship that entails the “kinds of spaces created by media, and the effects that existing spatial arrangements have on media forms as they materialize in everyday life” (p. 1). </p>
      <p>As digital media have provided individuals new opportunities for inexpensive ways to network, mobilize and distribute content, the emergence of online activism and social movement media has raised intellectual questions about the role of alternative or “subaltern counterpublic” online spheres (Fraser, 1990; Lim, 2014; Downey & Fenton, 2003). Within scholarly conversations regarding digital media and their functions in society, scholars’ positions can be categorized within two primary arguments. The “pipeline” framework perceives new media as another ‘factory’ for the production and distribution of cultural products, while the “frontier” argument views it as participatory (Lievrouw, 2012). Social movements that began to employ the Internet during the 1990s, such as the well-documented anti-NAFTA struggle of the Zapatistas, illustrated the role digital media could play in rapidly mobilizing across space (Downing, 2001). According to Lim (2014), digital media spaces and networks can be used to propagate new narratives, new messages, new ideas that challenge the authority” (p. 62). Political economic analyses, on the other hand, have employed critical approaches to analyzing new media, demonstrating linkages between digital media space and labor (Fuchs, 2014). </p>
