<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>

</div>
<div class="section1"><p>On August 9, 2014, an 18-year-old black man by the name of Michael Brown was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. That one shooting would spark months of protests and unrest in Ferguson that would plaster the headlines of news media worldwide. The Ferguson protests would bring into the national conversation intense debates over police brutality, racial inequality, justice reform and many other issues.
<p>What our research has done is to provide an insightful, local and interdisciplinary analysis of the Ferguson activist movement. We explored the relationship between media, education and geography of the St. Louis area and how that has shaped the community activism we saw in Ferguson. While much researchhas been done about the political significance of the Michael Brown case, what we have focused on is the role of organizing and media activism in the aftermath of Michael Brown’s death.</p>
<p>Two main parts consist of this research: the media and social geography. In turn, we researched how these two parts come together to educate and inform the citizens of Ferguson into organizing themselves. Thus, this research will shed light onto local community activists and the local activism going on often left by news media in the background. Additionally, this research aims to combat the stereotype of communities of color being ill-resourced and unstable and show how these communities have the capability to organize and transform their environment. Essentially, this research goes beyond the singular national focus on policing that happened during the Ferguson protests and offers a broader picture of St. Louis’ racialized and classed dynamics through a local lens.

<div id="history">
<h3>HISTORY OF RACIAL AND SOCIECONOMIC DIVIDE</h3>
<p>St. Louis is one of the most segregated cities in the United States, and in St. Louis, it is no better exemplified than through the Delmar Divide. North of St. Louis's Delmar Boulevard is 95% black. South of it is two-thirds white (Cooperman).And not surprisingly, the northern part fares off worse economically and socially. None of this is coincidental; it is a result of a deliberate effort by racist institutions that it has turned out this way.</p>
<p>In 1900, St. Louis had more than 35,000 African-American residents, second only to Baltimore (Cooperman). Many white workers feared that they were taking away jobs, or that lower-paid workers would decrease the value of houses. Because of this economic tension, racist policies developed.</p>
<p>One of the first attempts was that St. Louis passed a reform ordinance, prohibiting anyone from buying a home in a neighborhood that was occupied by 75% of another race. SCOTUS striked this ordinance down, but racial covenants, which asked every family to sign a document agreeing to not sell their property to a black person, were still legal until 1948. Nevertheless, all this had effects in maintaining segregation in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Another method the government used to maintain segregation was eminent domain. In building highways and infrastructure, the government would purposely build it through African-American communities, essentially destroying them. The displaced residents were sometimes then given vouchers to live in public housing, such as the infamous Pruitt-Igoe, which basically moved entire populations of African-Americans. Some places were declared "slums" and therefore dangerous, and the governent destroyed those places.</p>
<p>There was segregation, but there was also different treatment of the the black and white communities that were segregated.  The government played a role in criminalizing the black parts of St. Louis. Local zoning policies allocated areas, which tended to be more populated by African-Americans, as "slums" or "ghettos" and thus needed more policing and "nuisance codes."</p>
<p>All these factors led to the segregation and socioeconomic divide one sees in St. Louis over time and history.</p>
