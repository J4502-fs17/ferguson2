<p id="introtext">On August 9, 2014, an 18-year-old black man by the name of Michael Brown was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. That one shooting would spark months of protests and unrest in Ferguson that would plaster the headlines of news media worldwide. The Ferguson protests would bring into the national conversation intense debates over police brutality, racial inequality, justice reform and many other issues.What our research has done is to provide an insightful, local and interdisciplinary analysis of the Ferguson activist movement. We explored the relationship between media, education and geography of the St. Louis area and how that has shaped the community activism we saw in Ferguson. While much researchhas been done about the political significance of the Michael Brown case, what we have focused on is the role of organizing and media activism in the aftermath of Michael Brown’s death.Two main parts consist of this research: the media and social geography. In turn, we researched how these two parts come together to educate and inform the citizens of Ferguson into organizing themselves. Thus, this research will shed light onto local community activists and the local activism going on often left by news media in the background. Additionally, this research aims to combat the stereotype of communities of color being ill-resourced and unstable and show how these communities have the capability to organize and transform their environment. Essentially, this research goes beyond the singular national focus on policing that happened during the Ferguson protests and offers a broader picture of St. Louis’ racialized and classed dynamics through a local lens.
